                'AGX 01': `<h2>AGX Mining</h2><p>Mining cryptocurrency is the process of validating and adding transactions to a blockchain network while competing to solve complex mathematical puzzles. It involves using computational power to find a cryptographic hash that meets the network's requirements, securing the blockchain and issuing new coins as a reward to miners.</p>

<p>Here's how it works:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Transaction Verification</strong> – Miners gather pending transactions from the network and validate them.</li>
    <li><strong>Block Formation</strong> – These verified transactions are grouped into a block.</li>
    <li><strong>Proof of Work (PoW) or Other Consensus Mechanisms</strong> – Miners solve a cryptographic puzzle (in PoW systems like Bitcoin) by finding a hash below a certain target. This requires computational power.</li>
    <li><strong>Block Addition</strong> – The first miner to find the correct hash broadcasts it to the network. If verified by other nodes, the new block is added to the blockchain.</li>
    <li><strong>Rewards</strong> – The winning miner receives newly minted cryptocurrency and transaction fees as a reward.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mining is a way to <strong>decentralize</strong> the verification process and maintain network integrity without a central authority. However, due to increasing difficulty and energy costs, many miners now use <strong>mining pools</strong> to combine computational power and share rewards.</p>` ,
                'AGX 02': `<h2>AGX Value</h2><p>Cryptocurrency as a store of value relies on its decentralized nature, limited supply, and security features. It enables microtransactions and peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions by providing a digital medium of exchange that operates outside traditional financial systems.</p>

<h3>1. Cryptocurrency as a Store of Value</h3>
<p>A store of value is an asset that retains its worth over time and can be saved, retrieved, and exchanged later without losing purchasing power. Crypto qualifies due to several factors:</p>

<h4>A. Scarcity & Limited Supply</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Many cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin (BTC), have a fixed supply (21 million BTC). This prevents inflation from eroding value over time.</li>
    <li>Unlike fiat currency, which can be printed at will, cryptocurrencies often follow deflationary models.</li>
</ul>

<h4>B. Decentralization & Security</h4>
<ul>
    <li>No central authority (banks or governments) controls crypto, making it resistant to manipulation.</li>
    <li>Blockchain technology ensures secure, immutable transactions, reducing fraud.</li>
</ul>

<h4>C. Portability & Accessibility</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Digital nature allows crypto to be stored in wallets and accessed globally without intermediaries.</li>
    <li>Users in countries with unstable currencies (hyperinflation economies) use crypto to preserve wealth.</li>
</ul>

<h4>D. Increasing Adoption & Liquidity</h4>
<ul>
    <li>As more businesses accept crypto, its usability increases.</li>
    <li>Stablecoins (USDT, USDC) act as reliable stores of value without price volatility.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Microtransactions: Small Payments at Low Cost</h3>
<p>Cryptocurrency enables small-value transactions (fractions of a cent) without the high fees associated with traditional payment systems.</p>

<h4>A. Why Crypto is Ideal for Microtransactions</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Low Transaction Costs</strong> – Traditional payment networks (Visa, PayPal) charge high fees for small transactions. Crypto transactions on networks like Lightning Network (Bitcoin) or Layer-2 Ethereum solutions drastically reduce costs.</li>
    <li><strong>Speed & Efficiency</strong> – Blockchain transactions can settle instantly or within seconds, unlike bank settlements that may take days.</li>
    <li><strong>Borderless Payments</strong> – No restrictions or currency conversion fees; anyone with an internet connection can participate.</li>
</ul>

<h4>B. Real-World Use Cases</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Gaming & Digital Content</strong> – Gamers use crypto for in-game purchases without centralized platforms taking a cut.</li>
    <li><strong>Streaming & Tipping</strong> – Platforms like Brave allow users to send micro-tips to content creators.</li>
    <li><strong>Subscription Models</strong> – Crypto-based pay-per-use services allow users to pay fractions of a dollar for specific content instead of committing to full subscriptions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Transactions</h3>
<p>P2P transactions remove intermediaries (banks, PayPal) and allow users to send crypto directly to each other without a third party.</p>

<h4>A. Advantages of P2P Crypto Transactions</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>No Banks, No Middlemen</strong> – No need for banks or clearinghouses to approve transfers.</li>
    <li><strong>24/7 Availability</strong> – Unlike banks with limited hours, crypto transactions occur anytime, globally.</li>
    <li><strong>Censorship-Resistant</strong> – Transactions cannot be frozen or blocked by financial institutions.</li>
    <li><strong>Lower Fees</strong> – Sending money across borders with traditional remittance services (Western Union) incurs high fees. Crypto allows direct, nearly instant payments at a fraction of the cost.</li>
</ul>

<h4>B. Examples of P2P Crypto Usage</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Remittances</strong> – Workers send crypto home instead of using expensive money transfer services.</li>
    <li><strong>Decentralized Marketplaces</strong> – Users trade goods/services in exchange for crypto without centralized platforms.</li>
    <li><strong>Privacy Payments</strong> – Some cryptocurrencies (Monero, Zcash) allow users to transact anonymously.</li>
</ul>` ,
